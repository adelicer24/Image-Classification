# Image Classification Project

## Alex Delicer

This website application will allow visitors to upload a digital image of an object that the image classification algorithm can identify. The website application will open with a welcome page that gives the users a description of the website and its purpose. The user will then be able to upload a digital image of the objects specified by the website. When the image is uploaded, it will be passed to the algorithm to be identified. After the image has been identified through by the algorithm, the image will be displayed on the website along with the amount of time it took the algorithm to identify the object and the algorithm's accuracy (if possible). From there the user can submit another image if they would like to test the algorithm again.
